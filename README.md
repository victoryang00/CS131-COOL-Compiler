# the Story of my Compiler

## Cause

I'm very cai in everything.
So I decided to teach myself in compiler.

I chose a course named CS131, listening the bullshit words of Long.

## Development

Oh, Parser and Lexical Analysis, 

from finite automate to NFA to DFA to minimized-DFA

from LL(1) to SLR(1) to LR(1)

PA1 PA2 and WA1 WA2 are hard enough.

midterm is nice and easy but I don't match the average points

OS DDL is coming. 

## Climax 

Long tried his best and group with me

Semantic Analysis and Code Generation are his work

And I'm in charge of the bonus Project

## Ending

Nothing.
